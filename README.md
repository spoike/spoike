### Hi there 👋

I'm a Swedish web application developer by day, gamer dad by night. This is what I do online:

- 🐦 Tweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spoike)
- 🎨 Draw stuff on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/workshop)
- 🥳 Occasionally work and host Leethack, a coder competition event
- 🏥 Sometimes help with fix PR's and issue reporting on various Github projects

Now go bother [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx).
